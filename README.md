Background and workflow detailing the steps of how to assemble the whole genome of the bacteria Salmonella enterica.

# Introduction
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has contributed much of our understanding of microbial pathogens. A primary goal of bacterial whole-genome assembly is to computationally reconstruct smaller and fragmented segments of DNA into a complete and closed circular genome. Another important goal is to align the constructed genome to the reference genome, allowing for variant calling and comparative genomics, which is crucial for identification of genetic differences such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions (indels) (Paranthaman et al., 2021). Salmonella. enterica (S. enterica) was chosen as the species of interest for this analysis due to its pathogenicity and its significant role in foodborne disease outbreaks (Zhang et al., 2021).
